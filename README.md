# 🛡️ SentinelCV

> Turning everyday cameras into intelligent safety systems.

**SentinelCV** is a real-time computer vision platform that transforms any CCTV, IP camera, webcam, or video stream into an AI-powered safety monitor.

It starts with its first module — **real-time fall detection** — and is built to grow into a full modular vision-intelligence platform covering industrial safety, surveillance, healthcare, and smart infrastructure.

## ✨ Features

- 🚶 Real-time human fall detection
- 📹 Works with CCTV, RTSP streams, USB webcams, and recorded video files
- ⚡ YOLOv8-powered detection pipeline
- 🔔 Instant Telegram alerts the moment a fall is detected
- 🖥️ Lightweight, real-time inference
- 🔧 Built to extend — fall detection is module one, not the whole product

## 🎯 Use Cases

| Elderly Care | Hospitals | Smart Homes |
|---|---|---|
| **Warehouses** | **Factories** | **Construction Sites** |
| **Assisted Living** | **Public Surveillance** | |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sreerevanth/SentinelCV.git
cd SentinelCV
```

Install the core dependencies (OpenCV, Ultralytics, NumPy, python-telegram-bot):

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy python-telegram-bot
```

Run the monitor:

```bash
python complete_monitor.py
```

> 📌 Set up your Telegram bot token and chat ID first — see `telegram bot details` in this repo for the setup steps used by `notification_alert_test.py`.
